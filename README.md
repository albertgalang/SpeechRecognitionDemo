# SpeechRecognitionDemo
Machine learning for speech recognition

## Datasets
The 'datasets' folder will hold the datasets to be used in the modeling process. The datasets are organized as follows:
* datasets/dev
* datasets/train
* datasets/test

The datasets are downloaded from [Huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) called [LibreSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asrhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr). Cloning this repo will not have the datasets. Please download them and extract in the associated folders listed above.
